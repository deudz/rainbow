# RAINBOW
**rainbow** is a small program that shows you your terminal's colors

## Usage
`-n, --normal`: shows the first 8 colors of the colorscheme.

`-b, --bright`: shows the last 8 colors of the colorscheme.

`-B, --big-normal`: same as `-n` but shows extra formating like blinking,
underlined, etc.

`-o, --big-bright`: same as `-B` but using bright colors.

## TODO
- [ ] Make the *COLORS* string changeable.
- [ ] Have string with custom formatting.
- Maybe:
    - [ ] Be able to change the colors to anything.
